=head1 NAME

Syntax::Feature::Loop - Provides the C<loop BLOCK> syntax for unconditional loops.


=head1 VERSION

Version 1.11


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use syntax qw( loop );

    loop {
       ...
       last if ...;
       ...
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Syntax::Feature::Loop is a lexically-scoped pragma that
provides the C<loop BLOCK> syntax for unconditional loops.

This module serves as a demonstration of the ability to
add keywords to the Perl language using
L<C<PL_keyword_plugin>|perlapi/PL_keyword_plugin>.


=head2 C<< use syntax qw( loop ); >>

=head2 C<< use Syntax::Feature::Loop; >>

Enables the use of C<loop BLOCK> until the end of the current lexical scope.


=head2 C<< no syntax qw( loop ); >>

=head2 C<< no Syntax::Feature::Loop; >>

Restores the standard behaviour of C<loop> (a sub call) until the end of the current lexical scope.


=head2 C<< loop BLOCK >>

Repeatedly executes the BLOCK until it is exited using C<last>, C<return>, C<die>, etc.

In other words, it behaves just like all of the following:

=over

=item * C<for (;;) BLOCK>

=item * C<while (1) BLOCK>

=item * C<while () BLOCK>

=back

Like other flow control statements, there is no need to
terminate the statement with a semi-colon (C<;>).
